# CodeGraph3D
a simple plugin for godot that adds 3d code graphs that looks like recroom-ish

embeds a slightly modified [CurveMesh3D](https://github.com/cloudofoz/godot-curvemesh/) ([Asset Library link](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1579)) to give it a class_name so I can embed it in types and construct it
